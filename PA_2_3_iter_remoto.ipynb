    "Python supports what is referred to as _iterable_ objects: generally, this means objects that can be easily used by Python's built-in and efficient iteration schemes. Examples are: list, tuple, dictionaries, and strings. You may be interested in reading about all of [the technical details here](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator); however, for this assignment the explanations here and examples below are sufficient. It is important to recognize this type of object exists in Python, so we can take advantage of it in our code, or so you can recognize the algorithms in other authors code.\n",
