Before you can start this assignment, read the theory pages in the book chapter [Errors in Python](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/programming/week_2_3.html):
- [Error types](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/_git/github.com_TUDelft-books_learn-python/2025/book/errors/error_types.html)
- [The Python traceback](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/_git/github.com_TUDelft-books_learn-python/2025/book/errors/error_types.html)

In this assignment you'll make exercises on:

1. [Iterable objects](./1_iter.ipynb)
2. [Modulo](./2_modulo.ipynb)
3. [Stem plots](./3_stem_plots.ipynb)
4. [Errors](.4_errors.ipynb)

You'll need to have done 1-3 to be able to make the workshop and group assignment.

You pass this PA if you:
- Correct output for task 1.4
- The notebook for exercise 3 runs without errors
- Figure from task 3.2 added to this repository from running the notebook.
- The notebook for exercise 4 runs without errors
- The py files for task 2 in the notebook don't raise errors when run
